# --- Stage 1: Build the Application JAR ---
# Use a robust JDK base image with Maven pre-installed to build the app
FROM maven:3.9.6-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Maven project files (pom.xml) first to leverage Docker layer caching
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src

# Build the Spring Boot application (this generates the target/data-modeling-service-*.jar)
# The '-DskipTests' flag is often used in Docker builds for speed; adjust as needed
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# --- Stage 2: Create the Final Runtime Image ---
# Use a lightweight JRE base image based on Java 21
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine AS final

# Set the working directory for the final application
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the executable JAR file from the 'build' stage to the 'final' stage
# The '*-SNAPSHOT.jar' assumes a standard Maven artifact name
COPY --from=build /app/target/data-modeling-service-*.jar app.jar

# Define the port the application listens on (adjust if your application uses a different port)
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
